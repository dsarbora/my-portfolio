              <p>Before joining Epicodus, I worked in food service. My roles in the food industry ranged from working at a local butcher shop to bartending. My experience in these fast paced, heavily customer-facing positions has made me an expert multi-tasker and an excellent communicator.</p>

              <p>I was the last bartender at The Old Spaghetti Factory in downtown Seattle, and the last hourly employee at the restaurant before it closed. After the closure, I returned to help move all the equipment and prepare the building for the new owners to take possession, and was gifted a piece of the bar as a keepsake for the end of the process. That location had been a Seattle landmark from 1970 until 2016, a stellar 46 year run.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>I have many friends and family members who are software developers, I have seen them work and always been able to understand and compartmentalize the problems they face without knowing the language syntax necessary to actually take the extra step toward solving programming problems. I'm a logical thinker who loves puzzles and pays close attention to detail, and I think I was made to live in the programming world.</p>
